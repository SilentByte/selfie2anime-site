This Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Selfie2Anime services (collectively, the “Service”), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

4. We collect the following types of information.

5. Information you provide us directly:

    1. User Content (e.g., photos and other materials) that you post through the Service. Communications between you and Selfie2Anime.

6. Analytics information:

    1. We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual User.

7. Cookies and similar technologies:

    1. When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Selfie2Anime and provide features to you.

8. Log file information:
   
    1. Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser or device.
   
   2. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

    2.

Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
    
10. Metadata:
    
    1. Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe how, when and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.
